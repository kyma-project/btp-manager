#  This GitHub action is designed to run end-to-end (e2e) tests on a Kubernetes cluster using the k3s distribution.
#  The action is triggered on pull requests to the main branch of the repository.
#  The action consists of a single job that runs on an Ubuntu-latest virtual machine and has the necessary permissions to read and write various resources.
#  The job has several steps:
#    - Checkout the repository code.
#    - Cache the ~/.cache/go-build and ~/go/pkg/mod directories to improve performance.
#    - Set up a docker registry and k3s cluster using a script called k3s-setup.sh.
#    - Set the pull request number as an environment variable.
#    - Run Go tests located in the testing/go directory, ensuring that the correct version of Go is used and the Go modules are tidied up before the tests are run.
#
#  Overall, this action ensures that the code changes made in the pull request do not break any end-to-end tests on a k3s cluster.
