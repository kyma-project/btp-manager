# Create a Service Instance with a Custom Secret

To have multiple service instances from different subaccounts associated with one namespace, you must use a custom Secret to create these service instances.

## Context

To create a service instance with a custom Secret, you must use the **btpAccessCredentialsSecret** field in the `spec` of the service instance. In it, you pass the Secret from the `kyma-system` namespace to create your service instance. You can use different Secrets for different service instances.

## Prerequisites

* A subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit

## Procedure

### Create Your Custom Secret

1. [Create an SAP Service Manager service instance](03-30-management-of-service-instances-and-bindings.md#create-a-service-instance) with the `service-operator-access` plan.
2. [Create a service binding](03-30-management-of-service-instances-and-bindings.md#create-a-service-binding) to the SAP Service Manager service instance you have created.
3. Get the access credentials of the SAP Service Manager instance from its service binding. Copy them from the BTP cockpit as a JSON.
4. Create the `creds.json` file in your working directory and save the credentials there.
5. In the same working directory, generate the Secret by calling the `create-secret-file.sh` script with the **operator** option as the first parameter and **your-secret-name**  as the second parameter.

    > [!WARNING] 
    > Once you set a Secret name in the service instance, you cannot change it in the future.

    ```sh
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyma-project/btp-manager/main/hack/create-secret-file.sh | bash -s operator {YOUR_SECRET_NAME}
    ```

    The expected result is the file `btp-access-credentials-secret.yaml` created in your working directory:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    type: Opaque
    metadata:
      name: {YOUR_SECRET_NAME}
      namespace: kyma-system
    data:
      clientid: {CLIENT_ID}
      clientsecret: {CLIENT_SECRET}
      sm_url: {SM_URL}
      tokenurl: {AUTH_URL}
      tokenurlsuffix: "/oauth/token"
    ```

6. To verify if you've correctly added the access credentials of the SAP Service Manager instance in your service instance, go to the CR `status` section, and make sure the subaccount ID to which the instance belongs is provided in the **subaccountID** field. The field must not be empty.

### Create a Service Instance with the Custom Secret

1. Create your service instance with:
   * the **btpAccessCredentialsSecret** field in the `spec` pointing to the custom Secret you have created
   * other parameters as needed<br>

    See an example of a ServiceInstance custom resource:

    ```yaml
    kubectl create -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1
    kind: ServiceInstance
    metadata:
      name: {SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME}
      namespace: {NAMESPACE_NAME}
    spec:
      serviceOfferingName: {SERVICE_OFFERING_NAME}
      servicePlanName: {SERVICE_PLAN_NAME}
      btpAccessCredentialsSecret: {YOUR_SECRET_NAME}
    EOF
    ```

2. To verify that your service instance has been created successfully, run:

    ```bash
    kubectl get serviceinstances.services.cloud.sap.com {SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME} -o yaml
    ```

    You see the status `Created`.
    You also see your Secret name in the **btpAccessCredentialsSecret** field of the `spec`.
