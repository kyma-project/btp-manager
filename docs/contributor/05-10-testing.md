# Run Unit Tests

## Run Unit Tests Using CLI 

To run the unit tests from the command line, use the following command from the BTP Manager main directory: 

```shell
make test
```
The details concerning the `test` rule (prerequisites and recipe) are defined in [`Makefile`](../../Makefile).

By default, the unit tests are run using the envtest cluster. 
Some of the unit tests are implemented using the [Gingko](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#top) library, but all the unit tests are invoked using the `go test ./... <some options>`.
You can find the exact invocation reflected in the console output along with messages confirming whether the envtest is used.
```

2023-01-13T08:24:45.981+0100  DEBUG   controller-runtime.test-env     starting control plane
```

### Run Unit Tests on Existing Cluster

You can run the tests on an existing cluster (not the envtest cluster) setting the value of the environment variable **USE_EXISTING_CLUSTER** to `true`.

```shell
USE_EXISTING_CLUSTER=true make test
```

> **NOTE:** The test suite assumes the proper state of the cluster before running. If problems with left-over resources occur, you can recreate the cluster or remove resources manually.

### Test Output Verbosity

The setting for the `go test` verbosity is `-v` (verbose, print the full output event for passing tests). This can be changed in the `make` recipe. 
For the `Ginkgo` tests execution, the default setting is `-ginkgo.v` (verbose). It can be changed, for example, for `very verbose` by setting the environment variable **GINKGO_VERBOSE_FLAG**.
The allowed values are: `ginkgo.succinct`, `ginkgo.v`, or `ginkgo.vv`. Accordingly, the output level will be: succinct, verbose, or very verbose.

```shell
GINKGO_VERBOSE_FLAG="ginkgo.vv" make test
```

### Filtering Labels
You can use the Ginkgo library labeling features to filter which tests specs are to be executed. 
For more details, see [Spec Labels](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#spec-labels) in Ginkgo documentation. To use labels for filtering, 
you need to instrument the test nodes (`Describe`, `It`, `When` et al.) in the [BtpOperator-controller `test.go`](../../controllers) files with labels, for example:
```go
	Describe("Provisioning", Label("test-provisioning", "smoke-test"), func() {
```
```go
	Describe("Deprovisioning", Label("test-deprovisioning"), func() {
```

You can use labels by setting the **GINKGO_LABEL_FILTER** variable. For example, to run only the specs labeled as `smoke-test`:
```shell
GINKGO_LABEL_FILTER="smoke-test" make test
```

Here is another example of a simple expression:
```shell
GINKGO_LABEL_FILTER="test-provisioning,test-deprovisioning" make test
```

### Environment Variables

All the above-mentioned environment variables can also be set in the [set-env-vars.sh](../../scripts/testing/set-env-vars.sh) file. The script sets the default values for all the environment variables used in the `go test` invocation. 
Changing the script contents is recommended if a more complex filtering expression is required, or if you frequently reuse the setting. However, you should not push the changes without considering 
how this affects Github Actions workflows.

## Run Test Suite with IDE

You can define environment variables in Run Configuration, run tests, change logs verbosity and use filtering features on an existing cluster.
