# GitHub Actions Workflows

## Auto Update Chart and Resources

The goal of the workflow is to update the chart (`module-chart/chart`) to the newest version, upload the operand's container images to the Kyma container images repository (`europe-docker.pkg.dev/kyma-project/prod`), render the resource templates from the newest chart, and create a PR with the changes. The workflow works on four shell scripts:

- `make-module-chart.sh` - downloads the chart from the [upstream](https://github.com/SAP/sap-btp-service-operator), from the release tagged as `latest` and places it in the `module-chart/chart`. 

- `update-external-images.sh` - updates `external-images.yaml`, which lists the operand's container images for uploading to the Kyma container images repository. The script extracts images from `module-chart/chart/values.yaml` by searching for the **repository** and **tag** fields.

After both scripts run, the workflow creates a pull request, which is auto-merged into the `main` branch. The merge commit triggers the [sync-external-images](../../.github/workflows/sync-external-images.yaml) workflow, which runs the [image-syncer](https://github.com/kyma-project/test-infra/tree/main/cmd/image-syncer) tool to upload the operand's container images into the Kyma container images repository.
	
- `make-module-resources.sh` - uses Helm to render Kubernetes resources templates. As a base, it takes a chart from the `module-chart/chart` and values to [override](../../module-chart/overrides.yaml). After Helm finishes templating with the applied overrides, the generated resources are put into `module-resources/apply`. The script removes all container images for the operator from the chart's [deployment manifest](../../module-resources/apply/deployment.yml). The operator sets the container images dynamically by reading [environment variables with container images](../../config/manager/set_external_images.yaml). The resources used in the previous version but not used in the new version are placed under `module-resource/delete`.
During the process of iterating over the `sap-btp-service-operator` resources, the script also keeps track of the GVKs to generate RBAC rules in [`btpoperator_controller.go`](https://github.com/kyma-project/btp-manager/blob/5a8420347c6a526f158fde7c41c3842eb54e2fda/controllers/btpoperator_controller.go#L135-L146), which feeds into RBAC **ClusterRole** in the [`role.yaml`](https://github.com/kyma-project/btp-manager/blob/5a8420347c6a526f158fde7c41c3842eb54e2fda/config/rbac/role.yaml#L1) resource kept in sync with `make manifests` just like any standard [kubebuilder operator](https://book-v2.book.kubebuilder.io/reference/markers/rbac.html). The script excludes all resources with a Helm hook "pre-delete" as it is not necessary to apply it. Additionally, all excluded resources are added to the `module-resources/excluded` folder, where you can see what was excluded.

- `add_module_managed_images_envs.sh` - sets container images environment variables in [`set_external_images.yaml`](../../config/manager/set_external_images.yaml) based on `external-images.yaml`. The script has strict definitions of environment variables and container images and requires manual adjustments when new container images appear in the upstream chart.
 
All these scripts can be triggered manually from the developer's computer.

To keep `module-chart/chart` in sync with the [upstream](https://github.com/SAP/sap-btp-service-operator), you must not apply any manual changes there.

## Release Workflow

See [BTP Manager Release Pipeline](03-10-release.md) to learn more about the release workflow.

## E2E Tests Workflow 

This workflow uses the DEV artifact registry, tags the binary image and OCI module image with the PR number, and calls the [reusable workflow](/.github/workflows/run-e2e-tests-reusable.yaml).

## Unit Tests Workflow

This workflow calls the [reusable workflow](/.github/workflows/run-unit-tests-reusable.yaml).

## Markdown Links Check Workflow

This [workflow](/.github/workflows/markdown-link-check.yaml) is triggered daily at midnight and by each PR on the `main` branch. It checks for dead links in the repository.

## Govulncheck Workflow

This [workflow](/.github/workflows/run-govulncheck.yaml) runs the Govulncheck.

## Auto Merge Workflow

This [workflow](/.github/workflows/auto-merge.yaml) enables the auto-merge functionality on a PR that is not a draft.

## All Checks Passed Workflow

This [workflow](/.github/workflows/pr-checks.yaml) checks if all jobs, except those excluded in the workflow configuration, have passed.

## E2E BTP Manager Secret Customization Test Workflow

The [workflow](/.github/workflows/run-e2e-sap-btp-manager-secret-customization-test.yaml) runs the E2E BTP Manager secret customization tests by calling the [reusable workflow](/.github/workflows/run-e2e-sap-btp-manager-secret-customization-test-reusable.yaml).

## Upload Release Logs as Assets Workflow

This [workflow](/.github/workflows/upload-release-logs.yml) uploads the logs from the release workflow as assets to the corresponding GitHub release. It is triggered on every published release event.

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. Checks out the repository
2. Waits for the "Create and promote release" workflow to finish if it is still in progress
3. Downloads logs from all attempts of the "Create and promote release" workflow for the current release
4. Uploads the downloaded logs as assets to the current GitHub release

## Reusable Workflows

There are reusable workflows created. Anyone with access to a reusable workflow can call it from another workflow.
