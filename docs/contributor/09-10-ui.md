# BTP Manager User Interface

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is in the experimental stage and is not yet available in the main branch or official releases.

## Prerequisites
1. Connect `kubectl` to your cluster by setting the **KUBECONFIG** environment variable.
    ```shell
    export KUBECONFIG=<path-to-kubeconfig>
    ```

2. For clusters different from Kyma (for example, k3d), you must install the [prerequisites](../../deployments/prerequisites.yaml).
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f deployments/prerequisites.yaml
    ```

## Run BTP Manager with UI
Follow the steps below to run BTP Manager with UI:

1. Ensure that the SAP BTP Operator module is deleted and verify that there are no existing BtpOperator custom resources (CRs) or deployments of both BTP Manager and the SAP BTP service operator.
    ```shell
    kubectl get btpoperators -A
    kubectl get deployment -n kyma-system btp-manager-controller-manager
    kubectl get deployment -n kyma-system sap-btp-operator-controller-manager
    ```
2. Clone the `btp-manager` repository and check out to the `sm-integration` branch.
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/kyma-project/btp-manager.git
    git checkout sm-integration
    ```
3. Set the **IMG** environment variable to the image of BTP Manager with UI.
    ```shell
    export IMG=europe-docker.pkg.dev/kyma-project/dev/btp-manager:PR-850
    ```
4. Run `deploy` makefile rule to deploy BTP Manager with UI.
    ```shell
    make deploy
    ```
5. Check if BTP Manager deployment is running.
    ```shell
    kubectl get deployment -n kyma-system btp-manager-controller-manager
    ```
    If you encounter the following error during Pod creation due to Warden's admission webhook:
    ```
    Error creating: admission webhook "validation.webhook.warden.kyma-project.io" denied the request: Pod images europe-docker.pkg.dev/kyma-project/dev/btp-manager:PR-850 validation failed
    ```
    you must scale the BTP Manager deployment to 0 replicas, delete the webhook, and then scale the deployment back to 1 replica.
    ```shell
    kubectl scale deployment -n kyma-system btp-manager-controller-manager --replicas=0
    kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io validation.webhook.warden.kyma-project.io
    kubectl scale deployment -n kyma-system btp-manager-controller-manager --replicas=1
    ```
6. Apply BtpOperator CR to create the Secret with credentials to access Service Manager.
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -n kyma-system -f examples/btp-operator.yaml
    ```
7. Port-forward to BTP Manager deployment.
    ```shell
    kubectl port-forward -n kyma-system deployment/btp-manager-controller-manager 8080:8080
    ```
8. Access the UI by opening `localhost:8080` in your browser.

### Cleanup
After testing the UI, you can delete the BtpOperator CR and BTP Manager deployment.
1. Delete the BtpOperator CR.
    ```shell
    kubectl delete -n kyma-system btpoperator btpoperator
    ```
2. Delete BTP Manager deployment by running the `undeploy` makefile rule.
    ```shell
    make undeploy
    ```
