# btp-manager
// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/btp-manager:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/btp-manager:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

## Deprovisioning

To start deprovisioning proccess use:

```
kubectl delete btpoperator yourbtpoperator
```

This command will trigger deletion of all service bindings, service instances and btp operator resources on your cluster.

At first, the deletion of deployment and webhooks which yourbtpoperator manages will happen, then deprovisioning flow will try to perform deletion in hard delete mode, which mean it will find all service bindings(and their secrets) and service instances across all namespaces and will try to make kubernetes delete on it.
The time limit for this operation is 20 minutes. 
After this time, or in case of error in hard deletion, the system will go into soft delete mode which mean deletion of finalizers from service instances and bindings.
Regardless of mode, at later step, the all btp operator resources marked with label "managed-by:btp-operator" are deleted. 
If proccess pass with success then finally finalizer on yourbtpoperator itself is removed and the resource is deleted.
If any error will happen during deprovisioning, then yourbtpoperator will be set to Error state.
